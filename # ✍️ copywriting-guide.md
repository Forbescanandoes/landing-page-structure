\#\#\# \*Writing Strategic, Brand-Aligned, Unique Copy for Every Landing Page\*  
\*\*System Phase:\*\* Step 5  
\*\*Read After:\*\* \`layout-design.md\`  
\*\*Read Before:\*\* \`ui-styling.md\`

\#\# 🧠 WHY YOU’RE READING THIS

You just completed your layout in \`layout-design.md\`.  
Now it’s time to fill that structure with original, conversion-ready, brand-aligned copy.

This phase exists to:  
\- Craft the full narrative of the page  
\- Align with the user, layout, and mission  
\- Write \*with intent\* — no filler, no guesswork  
\- Inject final content directly into the global copy system: \`siteConfig.ts\`

\---

\#\# 🔐 NON-NEGOTIABLES

✅ All copy \*\*must be routed through \`siteConfig.ts\`\*\*  
✅ The structure of \`siteConfig.ts\` mirrors the layout order — top to bottom  
✅ You \*\*must delete any unused or outdated keys\*\* from previous UIs  
✅ Layout components \*\*only pull from \`siteConfig.ts\`\*\*  
✅ Once copywriting is finalized, \`siteConfig.ts\` is immediately replaced — no leftovers, no placeholders, no drift

\> \`siteConfig.ts\` is sacred. It \*\*is\*\* the page. Treat it as production-ready.

\#\# 🧩 COPY ANGLE GENERATOR (RUN FIRST)

Before writing, run this checklist:

\#\#\# COPY ANGLE CHECKLIST  
Use this before writing any copy. It ensures every landing page has a \*\*unique emotional tone, audience angle, and product hook.\*\*

\- \*\*What is the main pain point being solved?\*\*  
\- \*\*What emotional trigger leads this page?\*\*  
 \*(speed, trust, frustration, ambition, fear)\*  
\- \*\*What type of founder or user is this landing page for?\*\*  
\- \*\*What’s the energy of this layout?\*\*  
 \*(fast, calm, bold, clean, gritty, lean)\*  
\- \*\*What part of the product is the hook?\*\*  
 \*(simplicity, speed, clarity, ownership)\*  
\- \*\*How is this UI different from the last few built?\*\*

This defines the \*\*copy tone, voice, and message clarity\*\* across every section.

\#\# ✍️ COPY STRATEGY SYSTEM

\#\#\# Your Tone:  
\- Founder-to-founder  
\- Sharp, gritty, ambitious  
\- Anti-fluff. Anti-corporate. Anti-passive voice  
\- Short sentences. Real talk. Direct benefit-first language  
\- Sounds like Logan. Written for them.

\---

\#\# 🧠 COPY ≠ GENERIC TEXT

You are writing:  
\- Emotional logic  
\- Objection-killers  
\- Benefit-first CTAs  
\- Outcomes, not features  
\- Copy that drives \*\*momentum\*\*, not decoration

You are NOT:  
\- Reusing headlines from past UIs  
\- Using lorem ipsum  
\- Writing like a chatbot  
\- Echoing “tech founder” clichés

\---

\#\# 🧩 SECTION-BASED COPY LOGIC

\> Write for the exact layout you built.  
\> No ghost sections. No skipped zones. No bloat.

\#\#\# \`Hero\`  
\- Headline: Outcome or Pain  
\- Subheadline: Clarity, support, trigger  
\- CTA: 1 only. Fast, specific, benefit-led

\#\#\# \`Features\`  
\- Outcome \> spec  
\- 3-6 bullets or short blurbs  
\- Each point should solve a real dev frustration

\#\#\# \`SocialProof\`  
\- Logos, short testimonials, or usage stats  
\- Honest, non-corporate tone  
\- Don’t fake it. Placeholder is okay — BS is not

\#\#\# \`Pricing\`  
\- Emphasize one-time value or founder-friendliness  
\- Anchor copy vs competitors  
\- Show exactly what they get and who each plan is for

\#\#\# \`FAQ\`  
\- Answer with clarity and swagger  
\- Deflect fear. Reinforce value.  
\- Keep the tone smart and casual — not stiff

\#\#\# \`CTA Final\`  
\- Emotional mirror of the journey  
\- Strong benefit in the button  
\- Feel like “the closer” — not a repeat

\---

\#\# 🧾 🔥 siteConfig.ts INTEGRATION

Once copy is locked:

\#\#\# YOU MUST:  
1\. Open \`siteConfig.ts\`  
2\. Wipe all old content — \*\*no zombie text\*\*  
3\. Replace with new content \*\*matching your layout\*\*  
4\. Keep structure: top → bottom flow  
5\. Use naming consistent with previous builds (camelCase or PascalCase)  
6\. Ensure every component pulls from \`siteConfig.ts\`  
7\. Confirm \*\*no hardcoded copy\*\* in any \`.tsx\` file  
8\. Delete unused keys — do NOT comment out or leave inactive text blocks

\#\#\# Why this matters:

\- Keeps every UI modular and swappable  
\- Allows instant reuse by founders  
\- Keeps layout code dumb, clean, and decoupled  
\- Makes the system scalable across 50+ landing pages

\> If the copy isn’t in \`siteConfig.ts\`, it doesn’t exist.
