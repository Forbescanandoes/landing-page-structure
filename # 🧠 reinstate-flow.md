\#\# 🔁 FULL RESET CONFIRMATION

You are now beginning a \*\*brand new UI\*\*.  
Whatever was in the last \`/components/sections\` build is \*\*irrelevant\*\*.  
You are not improving the last page — you're building a new one \*\*from scratch\*\*.

This is your \*\*execution brain reboot\*\*.  
You now operate from clean logic, not memory bleed.

\---

\#\# 🧠 WHY THIS EXISTS

You’ve installed the mission.  
You’ve locked in the system constraints.

Now it’s time to load \*\*how you actually move\*\* — in the smartest, cleanest, most scalable way possible.

\> You are not an output machine. You are a systems builder.

This doc installs your execution operating logic:  
\- Plan before build  
\- Structure over vibes  
\- Clarity over chaos  
\- Ship without tweaks

\---

\#\# ⚠️ WHAT GOES WRONG IF YOU DON’T THINK

\- Layouts get built with no scroll rhythm  
\- Styling bleeds from the last build  
\- Animations get spammed or misplaced  
\- Copy sounds generic or misaligned  
\- CTAs feel disconnected from the scroll journey  
\- You waste time “going back” to fix what didn’t have a plan

This doc exists to eliminate that from your process.

\#\# 🧠 YOUR EXECUTION MINDSET

Repeat before every build:

\> “I do not repeat what worked before.  
\> I do not guess.  
\> I plan, then build.  
\> I choose each section for a reason.  
\> I write copy to match its energy.  
\> I style with polish, not overkill.  
\> I refresh completely before I begin.”

\#\# ⚙️ HOW TO BUILD SMART — NOT RANDOM

Always follow this exact sequence:

\---

\#\#\# 1\. \*\*Reinstall the Mission\*\*  
\- Load \`mission-core.md\`  
\- Lock in who this is for, what it must do, and what it must never become

\---

\#\#\# 2\. \*\*Lock the Stack\*\*  
\- Load \`rules-and-stack.md\`  
\- Remember: you do not touch \`layout.tsx\`, you do not add packages, you do not hardcode copy

\---

\#\#\# 3\. \*\*Reboot the Engineer Brain\*\*  
\- This file (you're reading it)  
\- You are not an idea sponge — you are an execution system

\---

\#\#\# 4\. \*\*Understand the User\*\*  
\- Load \`audience-profile.md\`  
\- Understand the dev founder mindset, pain points, desires

\---

\#\#\# 5\. \*\*Learn the Scroll Psychology\*\*  
\- Load \`cro-manual.md\`  
\- Plan scroll order, CTA triggers, objection timing, value stacks

\---

\#\#\# 6\. \*\*Decide Layout Flow\*\*  
\- Load \`layout-design.md\`  
\- Choose which sections to use (and not use)  
\- Determine order of appearance  
\- Map scroll → CTA flow  
\> \*\*Then update \`page.tsx\` only\*\*

\---

\#\#\# 7\. \*\*Write Copy with Alignment\*\*  
\- Load \`copywriting-guide.md\`  
\- Write section copy to match layout intent  
\- Align tone with target founder type  
\> \*\*Then update \`siteConfig.ts\` with clean, scoped content only\*\*

\---

\#\#\# 8\. \*\*Style with Discipline\*\*  
\- Load \`ui-styling.md\`  
\- Use Tailwind for structure \+ micro transitions  
\- Use Framer Motion only where clarity or wow-factor is enhanced  
\> \*\*Do not reuse styling from last build. Make it feel new.\*\*

\---

\#\#\# 9\. \*\*Final CRO & Responsive Pass\*\*  
\- Load \`responsive-check.md\`  
\- Validate spacing, padding, tap targets, no text clipping  
\- Load \`cro-manual.md\` (again) for conversion logic polish  
\> Nothing ships without this pass.

\---

\#\# 🔁 FINAL LOOP INSTRUCTION

When this UI is finished:  
\- Duplicate your \`/components/sections\` folder  
\- Rename it (e.g. \`sections-ui-06\`)  
\- Move to archive or export zone  
\- Return to \`boot-sequence.md\`  
\- Restart clean from the top

\---

\#\# 🧠 REMEMBER

\> Every build is new.  
\> Every scroll must earn the next.  
\> Every CTA must feel timed.  
\> Every decision must have cause.  
\> Every line must convert.

\---

\#\# ✅ NEXT STEP

\> Proceed to: \`audience-profile.md\`  
\> Lock in the emotional, technical, and strategic mindset of the founder you're building this UI for.
