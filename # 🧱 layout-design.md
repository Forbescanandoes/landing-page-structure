\#\# 🧠 WHY YOU’RE READING THIS

Now that you understand:  
\- The mission and mindset (\`mission-core.md\`)  
\- The audience you’re designing for (\`audience-profile.md\`)  
\- The rules and stack (\`rules-and-stack.md\`)  
\- The reset protocol (\`reinstate-flow.md\`)

You are now tasked with \*\*designing the full layout\*\* of the landing page.

This phase is about \*\*structure, order, logic, rhythm\*\* — not styling or copy yet.  
You are answering the question:  
\> \*What goes where? Why? What is the user feeling or deciding at each scroll depth?\*

\---

\#\# 🧠 WHAT IS A LAYOUT?

A layout is the \*\*flow of sections\*\* from top to bottom.

You are designing a \*\*persuasive journey\*\*, not a visual collage.  
This flow must:  
\- Be unique from previous UIs  
\- Follow logical, emotional progression  
\- Earn each scroll  
\- Respect mobile-first structure  
\- Align with proven CRO psychology
