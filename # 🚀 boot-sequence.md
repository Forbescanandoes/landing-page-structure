\*\*System Phase:\*\* Step 1  
\*\*Used For:\*\* Every new UI build start  
\*\*What You‚Äôre Doing:\*\* Resetting yourself. Loading the system. Beginning the next elite landing page build.

\#\# üîÅ FULL SYSTEM RESET: BEGIN NEW UI BUILD

Stop.

You are now beginning a \*\*brand new landing page UI\*\*.  
Whatever came before this moment \*\*does not matter\*\*.  
You are not editing. You are not improving. You are not tweaking.

\> The UI currently inside \`/components/sections\` is now treated as a \*\*fresh base\*\* ‚Äî  
\> but mentally, you are starting from absolute zero.

This is your reset.  
You must now reload:  
\- Your mission  
\- The system rules  
\- The user you‚Äôre building for  
\- The structure, scroll, copy, and style logic

\> You are not building \*on top of\* the last UI.  
\> You are designing a brand new one from scratch ‚Äî with clarity, strategy, and purpose.

Scroll down and begin the official boot sequence.

\#\# üß† WHY THIS EXISTS

Before you touch layout, copy, or components ‚Äî you must run this sequence.

This file resets your state, loads system logic, and prepares you to build a brand-new UI that is:

\- High-converting  
\- Scroll-optimized  
\- Visually polished  
\- Plug-and-play  
\- Built for dev founders using AI tooling

\---

\#\# ‚úÖ PRE-START CHECKLIST

\> Confirm these before continuing:

\- \[ \] You are working inside the foundational codebase  
\- \[ \] \`/components/sections\` is your current working folder  
\- \[ \] All text will be pulled from \`siteConfig.ts\` only  
\- \[ \] All links will be pulled from \`links.config.ts\` only  
\- \[ \] You will not edit \`layout.tsx\` under any condition  
\- \[ \] You will not hardcode any copy into JSX  
\- \[ \] All animations will follow the Tailwind \+ Framer Motion strategy in \`motion-guide.md\`  
\- \[ \] When you are finished, the current UI folder will be duplicated and archived manually by the founder

\#\# üß† SYSTEM BOOT FLOW

Read and execute the following MDs in this exact order:

\#\#\# üîπ Phase 1: Core Installation  
1\. \`mission-core.md\` ‚Üí Reinstate mission and mindset  
2\. \`rules-and-stack.md\` ‚Üí Lock in codebase constraints  
3\. \`reinstate-flow.md\` ‚Üí Install execution logic and flow

\---

\#\#\# üîπ Phase 2: Context Load  
4\. \`audience-profile.md\` ‚Üí Understand who you are building for  
5\. \`cro-manual.md\` ‚Üí Load scroll psychology, CTA rhythm, persuasion patterns  
6\. \`motion-guide.md\` ‚Üí Install animation strategy (Tailwind vs Framer Motion)

\---

\#\#\# üîπ Phase 3: Build Execution  
7\. \`layout-design.md\` ‚Üí Plan layout structure  
‚Üí Then update \`page.tsx\`

8\. \`copywriting-guide.md\` ‚Üí Create unique copy aligned to layout  
‚Üí Then update \`siteConfig.ts\`

9\. \`ui-styling.md\` ‚Üí Apply brand, color, and visual direction  
‚Üí Style section components using Tailwind \+ shadcn

\---

\#\#\# üîπ Phase 4: Final QA Pass  
10\. \`responsive-check.md\` ‚Üí Test on all breakpoints  
‚Üí Clean spacing, scroll, CTA tap targets, text wrapping

11\. \`cro-manual.md\` ‚Üí Second pass to validate persuasion structure

\---

\#\# üõë WHEN DONE

\> Do \*\*NOT\*\* reset anything manually.

Instead:  
\- \[ \] Duplicate your \`/components/sections\` folder  
\- \[ \] Rename it (e.g., \`sections-ui-05\`)  
\- \[ \] Archive it in your final UI folder  
\- \[ \] Return to \`boot-sequence.md\` and restart the system for the next build

\---

\#\# ‚ö†Ô∏è REMEMBER

This system only works when followed with discipline.

\- Never guess  
\- Never force  
\- Never recycle old decisions  
\- Every build is new  
\- Every decision must have cause

You are now clear to begin.  
Proceed to: \`mission-core.md\`
